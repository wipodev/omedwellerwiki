The **Omedweller** mod adds a new companion to your world that when hungry turns into a terrifying monster. This mod is designed based on the youtuber **Omenaso**.

Once you start a new world your new friend the **Omebuddy** will follow you everywhere, making it the perfect companion for your adventures as he fights for you till the end. Everything will be fine as soon as you dont forget to feed him a cookie twice a day so his alter ego the **Omedweller** doesnt come out.

## Things to know about the Omebuddy

- **Massive Health Pool**: Omebuddy has 5000 health, making it extremely durable.
- **Loyal Companion**: Omebuddy follows you around but pls dont leave him behind as he will get lonely.
- **Combat Assistance**: If you give Omebuddy a sword, it will defend you against any attacker.
- **Emotional System**:
  - Giving Omebuddy a cookie makes it happy.
  - Omebuddy now requires two cookies per day—one in the morning and one in the evening.
  - If you don’t give it a cookie in the morning (before midday), it gets angry and transforms into Omedweller at midday.
  - If it receives a morning cookie but no cookie in the evening (before midnight), it gets angry and transforms into Omedweller at midnight.

## Things to know about the Omedweller

- Constantly hunts you down once transformed.
- Breaks blocks in its path to reach you.
- Has multiple attack types, each with different strength levels.
- Only disappears if killed or after one minute of existence.
- When Omedweller disappears, Omebuddy respawns, restoring the cycle.

## Transformation via Ometeddy

- Omebuddy can transform when given an Ometeddy.
- The Ometeddy is craftable using red wool blocks placed in the upper left and upper right corners, one white wool block in the center of the top row, and a diamond in the center of the crafting table.
